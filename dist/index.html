          <p class="first">As a passionate and driven Software Engineer, I am focused on expanding my expertise in software implementation and design within a challenging, collaborative environment. I studied electronics because I wanted to understand how computers work, but I realised I enjoyed software more so I self taught myself Python, Kotlin and Javascript, and later pursued a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence to deepen my understanding of the cutting-edge technologies shaping our world today.</p>
          <p class="first">With a strong foundation in software engineering, I am dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge and skills, particularly in the realm of AI, and I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that make a meaningful impact. My commitment to learning is driven by a genuine curiosity to explore new technologies and methodologies.</p>
          <p class="first">Outside of my professional life, I enjoy language learningâ€” having studied Italian as an extra curricular outside of school, and more recently trying to teach myself Norwegian. I believe that the process of learning languages enhances my problem-solving skills and ability to adapt. Additionally, I am a huge music fan and am currently working toward my Grade 8 violin exam, further cultivating my discipline and creativity. In the rest of my free time I enjoying hiking and travelling.</p>
          <p class="first">I am excited to continue building my career and look forward to collaborating with like-minded professionals on impactful projects.</p>
